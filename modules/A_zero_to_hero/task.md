# File Word Count 04 – Text File Analyzer

Write a Python script that analyzes a given text file and reports the number of lines, words, and characters.

The script should:
1.  Accept a single command-line argument: the path to the file to analyze.
2.  Read the file and calculate the total number of lines, words, and characters.
3.  Print the results in a JSON format.
4.  Handle the case where the file does not exist.

Example usage:
```sh
python solution.py sample.txt
```

Example output:
```json
{
  "lines": 10,
  "words": 152,
  "characters": 850
}
```
