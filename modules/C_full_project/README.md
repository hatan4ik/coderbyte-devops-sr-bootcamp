# Module C – Full DevOps Project

This module is a mini end-to-end project:

- Python web app with `/health` and `/metrics` endpoints
- Dockerfile for container image
- Terraform to provision storage + IAM skeleton (AWS-style)
- Kubernetes manifests for Deployment + Service

Use this as a base for:
- Coderbyte take-home assignments
- System design discussions
- CI/CD pipeline experiments
