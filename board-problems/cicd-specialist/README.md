# CI/CD Specialist Problems - Elena Volkov

**Focus**: Release automation, quality gates, safe deploys  
**Mantra**: "Ship fast, ship safe, ship often."

## Available Problems
- [Problem 1: Basic CI Pipeline](problem-1/problem.md) — Lint, test, build with PR status checks ([solution](problem-1/solution.md), [code](problem-1/solution))
- [Problem 2: Supply Chain Scanning](problem-2/problem.md) — Secret scan, SAST, SBOM generation ([solution](problem-2/solution.md), [code](problem-2/solution))
- [Problem 3: Advanced Pipeline with Gates](problem-3/problem.md) — multi-stage GitHub Actions pipeline with security gates, approvals, rollback, and notifications ([solution](problem-3/solution.md), [code](problem-3/solution))
- [Problem 4: Blue/Green Deployment Pipeline](problem-4/problem.md) — Blue/green stages, health checks, rollback, notifications ([solution](problem-4/solution.md), [code](problem-4/solution))

## How to Use
- Start from Problem 03 to model production-ready pipelines with guardrails.
- Keep quality gates (coverage, security, performance) visible in pipeline output.
- Practice rollback and notification flows; treat them as non-negotiable requirements.
