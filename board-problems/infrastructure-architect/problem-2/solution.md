# Solution – Cost Optimization Plan

## Approach
- Produce an actionable cost plan with quantified savings and enforcement guardrails.

## Steps
- Rightsize compute/storage; propose RIs/Savings Plans with estimates; storage lifecycle policies (S3/EBS snapshots).
- Identify data transfer optimizations (VPC endpoints, caching/CDN).
- Add budgets/alerts; document assumptions and phased rollout.

## Validation
- Cost estimates via calculators/Cost Explorer; test budgets fire; lifecycle policies apply in test.
