# Module 5: Containers and Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)

Welcome to Module 5 of the GCP Zero to Hero series. In this module, we'll dive into the world of containers and orchestration with a focus on Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE), Google's managed Kubernetes service.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

- Understand the fundamentals of containers and Docker.
- Differentiate between Docker, Kubernetes, and GKE.
- Provision a GKE cluster using the `gcloud` CLI and Terraform.
- Deploy a containerized application to a GKE cluster.
- Understand GKE networking and scaling concepts.
- Monitor and manage GKE clusters.

## Containers Fundamentals

A container is a lightweight, standalone, executable package of software that includes everything needed to run it: code, runtime, system tools, system libraries and settings.

**Docker** is the most popular containerization platform. It allows you to build, ship, and run applications in containers.

## Kubernetes and GKE

**Kubernetes** (also known as K8s) is an open-source system for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.

**Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)** is a managed, production-ready environment for deploying containerized applications. It brings our latest innovations in developer productivity, enterprise-readiness, and cost-optimization to your container-based workloads.

## Module Structure

- **Code Examples**: Practical examples of how to create GKE clusters and deploy applications using different tools.
- **Problem 1: Create a GKE Cluster**: A hands-on lab to create your first GKE cluster.
- **Problem 2: Deploy an Application**: A practical exercise to deploy a sample application to your GKE cluster.
