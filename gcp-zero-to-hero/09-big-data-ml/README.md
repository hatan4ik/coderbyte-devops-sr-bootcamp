# Module 9: GCP Big Data & ML

This module provides a high-level introduction to GCP's powerful data analytics and machine learning services. We will give a brief overview of **BigQuery**, Google's serverless data warehouse, and **Vertex AI**, the unified platform for machine learning.

## Key Topics

### BigQuery
1.  **Serverless Data Warehousing**: Understanding how BigQuery allows you to analyze terabytes of data in seconds without managing any infrastructure.
2.  **Public Datasets**: Exploring the vast collection of public datasets available for analysis.
3.  **Querying Data**: Running SQL queries using the BigQuery UI or the `bq` command-line tool.
4.  **Loading Data**: An overview of how to load your own data into BigQuery from services like Cloud Storage.

### Vertex AI
1.  **Unified ML Platform**: Understanding how Vertex AI brings together all of Google's ML tools under one roof.
2.  **AutoML**: How to train high-quality custom machine learning models with minimal effort and ML expertise.
3.  **Custom Training**: An overview of how to run custom training code on Vertex AI's managed infrastructure.
4.  **Model Serving**: Deploying trained models to get predictions.

## Labs

- **Problem 1**: Use the `bq` command-line tool to query a public dataset and answer a specific question.
- **Problem 2**: A conceptual lab outlining the steps to create a dataset in Vertex AI and start an AutoML image classification training job.
