# Module 9: Big Data and Machine Learning

Welcome to the final module of the GCP Zero to Hero series. This section provides a high-level introduction to Google Cloud's powerful Big Data and Machine Learning (ML) platforms.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand the purpose of BigQuery, Dataproc, and Vertex AI.
- Run interactive queries on large datasets using BigQuery.
- Understand how to run Spark and Hadoop jobs with Dataproc.
- Get an introduction to training no-code ML models with Vertex AI's AutoML.
- Differentiate between GCP's various data and ML services.

## BigQuery

**BigQuery** is a fully managed, serverless data warehouse that enables super-fast SQL queries using the processing power of Google's infrastructure. You can use it to analyze petabytes of data in seconds.

## Dataproc

**Dataproc** is a fully managed and highly scalable service for running Apache Spark, Apache Flink, Presto, and other open source tools and frameworks. Use Dataproc for data lake modernization, ETL, and secure data science, at scale.

## Vertex AI and AutoML

**Vertex AI** is Google Cloud's unified ML platform for building, deploying, and scaling ML models. A key feature of Vertex AI is **AutoML**, which enables developers with limited machine learning expertise to train high-quality models specific to their business needs.

## Module Structure

- **Code Examples**: Scripts for querying BigQuery, running a Dataproc job, and interacting with AutoML.
- **Problem 1: Run a BigQuery Query**: A lab to query a public dataset using SQL in BigQuery.
- **Problem 2: Train an AutoML Model**: A practical exercise to train an image classification model without writing any code.
