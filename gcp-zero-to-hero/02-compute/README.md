# Module 2: GCP Compute Engine

This module focuses on the core compute service in GCP: **Google Compute Engine (GCE)**. GCE provides scalable, high-performance virtual machines (VMs) running in Google's data centers.

## Key Topics

1.  **VM Instances**: Learn how to create, start, stop, and delete virtual machines.
2.  **Machine Types**: Understand the different machine families (E2, N2, etc.) and how to choose the right size for your workload.
3.  **Persistent Disks**: Learn about boot and data disks, disk types (standard vs. SSD), and snapshots for backups.
4.  **Instance Templates**: Create reusable templates to launch consistent VMs quickly.
5.  **Startup Scripts**: Execute scripts automatically when a VM boots to install software or perform configurations.
6.  **Instance Metadata**: Query and use metadata to create self-aware applications.

## Labs

- **Problem 1**: Create a customized GCE virtual machine using the `gcloud` CLI and a startup script.
- **Problem 2**: Define and provision a GCE virtual machine using Terraform.
