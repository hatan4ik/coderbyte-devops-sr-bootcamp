# Module 1: GCP Foundations

Welcome to the first module of the GCP Zero to Hero series. This module covers the absolute fundamentals required to operate effectively and securely within the Google Cloud ecosystem.

## Key Topics

2.  **Billing**: How to set up billing accounts, budgets, and alerts to control costs.
3.  **Identity and Access Management (IAM)**: Managing users, groups, and service accounts. Understanding primitive, predefined, and custom roles. The principle of least privilege is a core focus.
